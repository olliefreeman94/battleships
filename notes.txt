. blank
S ship
M miss
H hit

For run.rb senario to pass
- return list of unplaced ships
- record ship placement
- return board state to UserInterface

To be implemented
- review coordinate logic: origin at bottom left of board; ships placed vertically upwards and horizontally right from given starting position
    restructure array to record board state more intuitively
- check whether ship available to validate user input (UserInterface)
- record hits and/or sunk ships against ship list?
- update ship_at? to handle hit ships

Additional functionality
- initialize Game with custom ship array, and board size, rather than hardcoding this
- distinguish between cruiser and submaraine (both length 3 ships)
