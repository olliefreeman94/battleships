GOAL: allow user to place all ships on board during game set up

Task list
- add #status to Board class
- validate user input when placing ships
    (i.e. ship not already placed, valid orientation, valid board location, not overlapping another ship)
- validate args passed to Game #ship_at?
- refactor UserInterface #run, and update run.rb set up and script
- update Game #ship_at? to handle hit ships?
- refactor to use MVC model?
- update UserInterface to handle formatting terminal output (e.g. list of unplaced ships)
    then update other classes to return unformatted information
- create integration test suite

Additional functionality
- allow duplicate ship lengths within ship list (e.g. cruiser and submarine, both length 3)
